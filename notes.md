nested level of child recursions of over 50 (100 was tested before) always fails during deserialisation somehow

big files needed in xml special treatment because of incredible memory usage even then (32gig almost not enough)

nestings of 10000 is not possible with python and json because even recursion level to the max is not enough

incredible sizes in memory of these datasets (calculate some percentage maybe)

protobuf got specialised implementations because generalised approach was way to slow and even lost to json in many aspects then

xml and protobuf generally are a headache
