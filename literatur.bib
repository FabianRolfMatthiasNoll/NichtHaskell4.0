abstract = {This article compares binary and XML object serialization on Java and Microsoft .NET platforms from the performance and size perspective. It uses three different types of objects and different number of objects to make a comparison which reflects real-world circumstances. The article has the following contributions: (1) it compares binary and XML serialization between Java and .NET to compare the efficiency of both platforms; (2) it compares binary and XML serialization within the platforms to compare the differences between the two serialization types; (3) it studies the reasons for performance differences and provides possible performance optimizations.},
